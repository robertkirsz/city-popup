# City Popup

## Setup

1. Clone the repo
2. `cd city-popup`
3. `yarn install`

## Development

1. Run a local server from the repo's root folder (I suggest using httpster - install it with `yarn global add httpster` if you don't have it already, then run it with `httpser` and navigate to `localhost:3333`)

## Production

More info soon
